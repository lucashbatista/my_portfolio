# 💻 My Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. My approach centers on transforming complex data into clear, measurable business value.

Each project below showcases my **end-to-end analytical process**, spanning rigorous data cleaning and statistical modeling, through to actionable recommendations.

A critical component of every repository is the **`README.md` file**, which serves as an **executive summary**. This ensures that stakeholders and hiring managers can quickly grasp the **problem statement, methodology, key findings, and business recommendations** before diving into the code.

This emphasis on structured communication is how I ensure technical insights translate directly into strategic decisions.
